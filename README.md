_Having struggled through the nightmare of trying to secure a Global Entry interview in NYC, Allie and Nicholas decided to ditch the constant refreshing and instead create a website to do the heavy lifting for them. Introducing, **geal** . . ._

**_geal_** utilizes an API from the Department of Homeland security to query for information about Global Entry interview locations and available appointments. 

**How it works:**
+ Choose from a list of states that have active Global Entry interview locations
  + These database is queried every reload so you can be assured that these active locations are up to date
+ After selecting a state, choose from the interview locations within that state
  + The first cloud will then auto-populate with the details of the selected location
  + And the second cloud will auto-populate with the details of the next available appointment
+ If you have a specific timeframe in mind for your interview, you can input a custom timeframe
  + If you choose a custom timeframe the cloud will adjust to show appointment information for this time frame
+ If you're not finding what you're looking for, you can choose to set up an alert that will let you know if an appointment becomes available
  + Simply input how often you want the site to re-check the API for new appointment availabilities
  + And if a new appointment is found, it will alert you with a chime and redirect you to the Global Entry website so you can be first inline to book the appointment
