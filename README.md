_Having struggled through the nightmare of trying to secure a Global Entry interview in NYC, Allie and Nicholas decided to ditch the constant refreshing and instead create a website to do the heavy lifting for them. Introducing, **geal** . . ._

**_geal_** utilizes an API from the Department of Homeland security to query for information about Global Entry interview locations and available appointments. 

**How it works:**
+ Choose from a list of states that have active Global Entry interview locations
  + These database is queried every reload so you can be assured that these active locations are up to date
